sais-lite-LCP-0.0.1
----------------------

This is an ad-hoc-implementation of the code described in

"Inducing the LCP-Array" (http://arxiv.org/abs/1101.3448)

by Johannes Fischer.

It is based on Yuta Mori's sais-lite 2.4.1 (http://sites.google.com/site/yuta256),
which, in turn, is an implementation of the  following paper:

Ge Nong, Sen Zhang and Wai Hong Chan
Two Efficient Algorithms for Linear Suffix Array Construction
DCC 2009.

To compile, type 'make'. Then run ./suftest <testfile>.
